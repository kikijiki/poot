**Decode degradation - steady decode tok/s vs context length (ISL), higher is better:**

| framework | ISL 128 | ISL 2048 | ISL 8192 |
|---|---|---|---|
| poot (rocm) | 101.8 | 73.0 | 55.2 |

**TPOT p50 ms (per-token decode cost, prefill excluded) vs ISL, lower is better:**

_Memory numbers come from one external sampler (total device VRAM, process-tree RSS) under the one-engine-per-GPU assumption. Peak power W and energy Wh come from the same sampler (NVML board power draw, or amdgpu hwmon power on AMD, integrated over wall-clock time); omitted when the device exposes none. Timing comes from each runner. Cells with a precision or format mismatch vs the matched target carry a note; vLLM VRAM reflects its KV-pool reservation unless run at a low gpu_memory_utilization.
